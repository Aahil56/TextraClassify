# TextraClassify

## Overview

TextraClassify is a text classification project that utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify text data into predefined categories. This project is implemented in Python and leverages algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and others to achieve accurate text classification.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stemming, and vectorization of text data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of multiple algorithms for text classification including Naive Bayes, SVM, and more.
- **Model Evaluation**: Use of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
- **Prediction Interface**: Easy-to-use functions for making predictions on new text data.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation
  - `nltk` for natural language processing
- **Dataset**: 
  - '20 newsgroups' dataset from kaggle.

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Designed and implemented the data preprocessing pipeline to clean and prepare text data for modeling.
  - Developed and trained machine learning models, tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance.
  - Created a user-friendly interface in Jupyter Notebook for training models and making predictions.
  - Conducted extensive testing and evaluation of models to ensure high accuracy and reliability. 

- **Achievements**:
